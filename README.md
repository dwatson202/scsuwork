A listing of my projects created while enrolled at SCSU Information Security Program


Crypto Class CNA 438
- The zip file is what was submitted to the instructor for each assignment.
- Many other files exist that show small code to test or implement smaller parts of the problems/program. For example, CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem).
- Assignments had a week to be completed with the requirements. Therefor, they might not be great looking or look unprofessional. The goal was to get something working that would get a grade, not create a project that would be running on someones system for a lifetime.
- AND FINALLY: DON'T USE THESE IN PLACE OF REAL ENCRYPTION LIBRARIES. THIS CODE IS NOT FULLY TESTED AND MEANT AS A TOY. IT MOST SURELY HAS BUGS THAT IMPACT ENCRYPTION. MANY OF THESE METHODS USED ARE NOT SECURE AND ARE OUTDATED.
