A listing of my projects created while enrolled at SCSU Information Security Program

I held off for several years posting my class work on my public github for concern of students cheating off me. I believe many of the professors for some of the harder classes (crypto for example) have retired or are no longer teaching at SCSU MN. I believe its safe to upload my projects from my class.

--- STUDENTS ARE NOT ALLLOWED TO USE MY WORK IN A CLASS. ---
If you are professor of a class at SCSU MN please note that if you find work that looks a lot like mine its a good idea to confront the student.


Crypto Class CNA 438
- The zip file is what was submitted to the instructor for each assignment.
- Many other files exist that show small code to test or implement smaller parts of the problems/program. For example, CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem).
- Assignments had a week to be completed with the requirements. Therefor, they might not be great looking or look unprofessional. The goal was to get something working that would get a grade, not create a project that would be running on someones system for a lifetime.
- Some Assignments do not have zip files, the assignemnt was stil sent, however, with a file from the folder. The files might exist on my flash drive I used as my main storage from college. (Please to ask me to upload them)
- AND FINALLY: DON'T USE THESE IN PLACE OF REAL ENCRYPTION LIBRARIES. THIS CODE IS NOT FULLY TESTED AND MEANT AS A TOY. IT MOST SURELY HAS BUGS THAT IMPACT ENCRYPTION. MANY OF THESE METHODS USED ARE NOT SECURE AND ARE OUTDATED.

Dear Students of CNA 438:

If you are trying to complete a programming assignment for this class, I highly recommend you head to the library basement at SCSU. Its very clear from reading these books that the professors at SCSU used these books to construct the class work. I found many books that looked like the course work 1 for 1. So it is worth your time to get to know a few shelves in the basement of the library. (I think Row S, T, R where some of the best rows.) Ask the librarian for help.

A great book is the Handbook of Applied Cryptography Book by Alfred Menezes, Paul van Oorschot, and Scott Vanstone

This huge book has everything you could want for this class. It even has sudo code which can be used to implement your programming into your favorate language.

My second recommendation is a book by CRC Press entitled Algorithmic Cryptanalysis by Antoine Joux.

This is a must read for this class. It has all the good stuff explaned in a way you can understand. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn how to implement popular cryptos.

If you are still confused as a student I would recommend looking at books in the subject of linear algebra.
It is used hevaly in this subject. If you haven't already taken this class it should be done before you sign up for this 400 level course. It makes understanding the basics of matrix work much easier.

You could also review the topic of Descrete Math more. The CRT and co-prime (AKA relative prime numbers) is a major topic in asymmetrical encryption.

CNA 431-432 OSI Model and other subjects

When I took this class we had some side project of Risk Assement that had to be completed on short notice. The focused on evaulating risk. We were given a senario and had to compute the EF, SLE, ARO, and ALE for a set of servers.

CSCI 220

In this class we learned how computers work by boolean math and impliemented that into real wires and descrete ICs. This class is known for having frustrating lab that doesn't work. I can't share my work from this class because this class is still running in the same form and hasn't change much over the years. To share my work would only allow students to cheat of my work. We made decrete adders and a 7 segment driver as projects. The class focused mostly on boolan logic and its applications in computer sci.

What I learned is key (take note future students):

Use a software program to simplify your logic. Use another program to draw your layout on your breadboard. I found a program (name excapes me at this point) that allows for a perfect 1 to 1 printout of the breadboard curcit. This allows you to play LiteBright with your breadboard. You know it will work when you have all the parts connected. Buy your own jumper wires with male pins to make this possible. The community lab provided pins and chips are going to fail on you. If you have another 100$ spend it on your own set of ICs and jumper wires. This will save you a lot of time and get you and your co-lab partern out of hte lab in 20 mins. The lab room isn't very comfy and is very stuffy with 30 students in a small room.
